I created one app called as The Panorama View that is based on:

1.React-Pannelum library
2.supabase
3.React-Hook-Form
4.React-Hook-Router
5.styled-components
6.React-Query



In this application you can register and later  will be able to upload the panorama-photos.Also, you will be able to add,edit and delete some hotspots of the uploaded photos. In these hotspots you could add and remove the tour (the hotspot that has tour could send you in image that you want to see automatically).

Also, there is one Navigation Bar that has Settings,Projects and Profile.

In Profile you can change the information of your account.
In Settings you can change the information of your panorama-configuration.
In Projects you can add,remove,edit the projects of your account
